summary: The ROS 2 teleop snap
description: |
  The ROS 2 teleop snap allows for teleoperating a robot
  from either the keyboard, gamepad or leave it to the navigation stack.

  The snap offers the possibility to teleoperate the robot from a joystick with:

    snap start ros2-teleop.joy

  This app launches both the gamepad driver as well as the joy teleop node.

  Parameters for the joystick application are:

    - joy-vel (string, default: 'joy_vel')
    - joy-dev (string, default: 'dev/input/js0')
    - joy-config (string, default: '')
    - config-filepath (string, default: '')
    - publish-stamped-twist (bool, default: false)

    At least one between the joy-config and the config-filepath parameters must be set for the application to run.

    In case both joy-config and config-filepath are set, the configuration file will take precedence.

    The upstream package offers some default joystick configurations.
    Those can be set up with the joy-config parameter as follows:

    snap set ros2-teleop joy-config="ps3"

    In alternative, a custom configuration file can be used. The file can be provided
    by means of a URL. In such case, the snap will download the file and
    place it in `$SNAP_COMMON/config/joy_teleop.config.yaml`.
    To configure the config-filepath to a URL:

    snap set ros2-teleop config-filepath="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robot-repo/joy_teleop.config.yaml"

    Note: the URL must be reachable by the snap. When using a URL,
    the configuration file will be downloaded everytime the joy app is launched.
    Therefore a configuration update upstream will be applied with the application relaunch.

    Otherwise to configure the config-filepath to a local configuration file:

    snap set ros2-teleop config-filepath="/var/snap/ros2-teleop/common/config/joy_teleop.config.yaml"

    The local configuration should be at a path accessible to the snap such as $SNAP_COMMON.

  The robot can also be teleoperated from a keyboard (e.g. SSH) by launching the application with:

    ros2-teleop.key

  Optional parameters for the keyboard application are:
    key-vel (string, default: 'key_vel')

  The snap makes use of a topic multiplexer to switch from one source to another.
  Its input topic can be selected as,

    ros2-teleop.mux-select <topic>

  The topics names can also be configured with snap parameters:

    - cmd-vel (string, default: "cmd_vel")
    - nav-vel (string, default: "nav_vel")
    - web-vel (string, defautl: "web_vel")

  Note that when launching the joy or key app,
  the appropriate topic is automatically selected.
